# LoanM8
LoanM8 (pronounced "Loan Mate") is a financial visualization tool for past, present, and future students alike!
Right now, it is a functional interface for determining how much interest will accrue
over the lifetime of your loan.

## Philosophy
As a college graduate with student loan debt, I found calculators on sites such as Navient and Student Loan Hero to be disappointing. They lacked the capacity to allow borrowers to experiment with different payments, and failed to present information in an informative way. LoanM8 is a loan payment calculator/visualizer that I much prefer, and I hope you do too.

***Please note that all logic is client-side. Nothing you do is stored on, or even sent to, a server.***

## Getting Started
LoanM8 provides a minimalist interface. To get started, create a loan by clicking on the '+' in 'Your Loans'. Whether you are a college graduate looking to reevaluate your repayment strategy, or a high school student looking to plan for your future, LoanM8 supports loans in repayment, as well as loans you have yet to borrow. You may track as many loans as you like. Once you have your loans set up, you may compare several monthly loan budgets to spread across all of your loans. With all of your information set up, click 'Project your loans', and LoanM8 will generate a series of visuals that help you understand total time and money commitments needed for each monthly loan budget you set.
