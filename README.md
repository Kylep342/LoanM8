# LoanM8
LoanM8 (pronounced "Loan Mate") is a financial visualization tool for past, present, and future students alike!
Right now, it is a funcitonal interface for determining how much interest will accrue
over the lifetime of your loan.

## Philosophy
As a college graduate with student loan debt, I found calculators on sites such as Navient and Student Loan Hero to be disappointing. They lacked the capacity to allow graduates to experiment with different payments, and failed to present information in an informative way. LoanM8 is a loan payment calculator/visualizer that I much prefer, and I hope you do too.
